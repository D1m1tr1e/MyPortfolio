            <span class="fontOverpass400">My name is Dieter von Stein. I started my career as a precision mechanic and
                then studied mechanical engineering. My work in method planning for digitalisation projects and
                production process development has sharpened my analytical thinking. I strive to develop innovative
                solutions to improve the efficiency and performance of our production.</span>
