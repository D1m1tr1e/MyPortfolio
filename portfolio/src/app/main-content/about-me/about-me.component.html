            <span class="fontOverpass400">Hi, I’m Dieter von Stein. I’m a precision mechanic and mechanical engineer
                with experience in method planning and process development. My goal is to develop innovative solutions
                to increase the efficiency and performance of our production. In addition to my main job, I’ve also
                discovered a passion for front-end development in my spare time. Designing appealing user interfaces has
                become an exciting hobby that complements my technical skills and encourages creative approaches to
                solutions.</span>
